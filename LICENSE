THE "DON'T SUE US, WE'RE JUST DEVELOPERS" LICENSE (DSUWD)

Copyright (c) 2024 The Sleep-Deprived Developers of TOTP Playground

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

THE CONDITIONS OF "PLEASE DON'T BLAME US":

1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Software. (Because lawyers say so)

2. You acknowledge that this Software was probably written at 3 AM after
   consuming unhealthy amounts of caffeine and existential dread.

3. Any bugs you find are not bugs, they are "undocumented features" that add
   character to the software experience.

4. If this software breaks your computer, your marriage, your hopes and dreams,
   or causes your cat to give you judgmental looks, that's between you and
   the universe. We are merely humble servants of the npm ecosystem.

5. You agree that reading this license counts as "entertainment" and we are
   not responsible for any productivity lost while reading sarcastic legal text.

THE DISCLAIMER OF "WE TRIED OUR BEST, OKAY?":

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE
USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

TRANSLATION FOR HUMANS:

- Use this code however you want
- If it breaks, that's your problem
- We're not responsible for anything ever
- Seriously, we wrote code that generates numbers, calm down
- Yes, you can sell apps built with this, but good luck explaining why you
  needed React to count to 6
- If you make millions from this, buying us coffee would be nice but not required
- Any resemblance to actual professional software is purely coincidental

SPECIAL CLAUSES:

THE "STACK OVERFLOW ACKNOWLEDGMENT":
Large portions of this software were definitely copy-pasted from Stack Overflow.
We acknowledge the anonymous heroes who answered our increasingly desperate
questions at 2 AM.

THE "DEPENDENCY HELL IMMUNITY":
We are not responsible for the 500MB of node_modules that this project requires.
That's just how web development works now. Don't shoot the messenger.

THE "PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT WARNING":
If you deploy this to production without proper testing, security review, and
a healthy dose of prayer, that's a "you" problem. We made a demo, not enterprise
software.

THE "TIME TRAVEL EXEMPTION":
This license is valid across all timezones and during leap seconds. However,
we are not responsible if this software somehow breaks the space-time continuum.
(Though honestly, given JavaScript's relationship with time, this is possible)

This license is compatible with:

- MIT License (our template)
- Apache License (if you squint)
- Your sanity (results may vary)
- Modern web development (nothing is compatible with that)

This license is NOT compatible with:

- Internet Explorer (but neither is anything else)
- Reasonable expectations
- Normal human sleep schedules
- The concept of "simple solutions"

Remember: In web development, everything is made up and the points don't matter.
But this license definitely does matter. Probably. Maybe. We're not lawyers.

---

"License written by caffeine-powered developers who have seen too much.
No attorneys were harmed in the making of this license."

For questions about this license, please submit a GitHub issue. For questions
about life, the universe, and everything, please consult Stack Overflow like
the rest of us.

P.S. If you actually read this entire license, you deserve a medal. Or therapy.
Possibly both.
